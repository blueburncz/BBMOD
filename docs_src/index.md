# BBMOD
Welcome to the official documentation of BBMOD 3.1.2!

BBMOD is an advanced 3D rendering solution for GameMaker Studio 2. It consists
of a custom model and animation file formats (`*.bbmod`, `*.bbanim`), a model
convertor (BBMOD CLI), a powerful and easy to use GML library, as well as PBR
shaders using which you can render models textured in professional, industry
standard software.
