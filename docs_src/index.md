# BBMOD
Welcome to the official documentation of BBMOD 3.16.7!

BBMOD is an advanced 3D rendering solution for GameMaker. It consists of a
custom model and animation file formats (`*.bbmod`, `*.bbanim`), a model
converter (BBMOD CLI), a powerful and easy to use GML library, as well as PBR
shaders using which you can render models textured in professional, industry
standard software.

If you are a new user, see the [Quickstart guide](./QuickstartGuide.html) for a
quick overview of how to use BBMOD.
