	/// it.
	Id,
	/// @member Whether the particle is alive. If not, then the rest of the data
	/// can be nonsense. All particles within a particle system are dead at the
	/// start.
	IsAlive,
	/// @member How long in seconds has the particle been alive for. This is set
	/// to 0 on spawn and increases on every update.
	TimeAlive,
	/// @member The particle's initial health value. Default value is 1.
	Health,
	/// @member The particle's remaining health. The particle dies when this
	/// reaches 0. Default value is 1, same as for {@link BBMOD_EParticle.Health}.

	/// emitter's Z position on spawn.
	PositionZ,

	/// @member The mass of the particle. Default value is 1 unit.
	Mass,
	/// @member The particle's resistance to motion. Default value is 0.
	Drag,
	/// @member Modulates particle velocity on collision. Default value is 0.

	/// @member If `true` then the particle has collided. This is set to
	/// `false` at the beginning of every update.

	/// Default value is 0.
	RotationY,
	/// @member The third component of the particle's quaternion rotation.
	/// Default value is 0.
	RotationZ,
